abstract = {{The spring bloom dominates the annual cycle of phytoplankton abundance in large regions of the world oceans. The mechanisms that trigger blooms have been studied for decades, but are still keenly debated, due in part to a lack of data on phytoplankton stocks in winter and early spring. Now however autonomous underwater gliders can provide high-resolution sampling of the upper ocean over inter-seasonal timescales and advance our understanding of spring blooms. In this study, we analyze bio-optical and physical observations collected by gliders at the Porcupine Abyssal Plain observatory site to investigate the impact of atmospheric forcing and light conditions on phytoplankton blooms in the temperate North Atlantic. We contrast three hypotheses for the mechanism of bloom initiation: the critical depth, critical turbulence, and dilution-recoupling hypotheses. Bloom initiation at our study site corresponded to an improvement in growth conditions for phytoplankton (increasing light, decreasing mixing layer depth) and was most consistent with the critical depth hypothesis, with the proviso that mixing depth (rather than mixed layer depth) was considered. After initiation, the observed bloom developed slowly: over several months both depth-integrated inventories and surface concentrations of chlorophyll a increased only by a factor of \textbackslashtextasciitilde2 and \textbackslashtextasciitilde3 respectively. We find that periods of convective mixing and high winds in winter and spring can substantially decrease (up to an order of magnitude) light-dependent mean specific growth rate for phytoplankton and prevent the development of rapid, high-magnitude blooms.}},

Continuously profiling ocean gliders with vertical resolution between 0.5 and 1 m provide more information on temporal variability throughout the water column than time series from moorings with sensors at a limited number of fixed depths. The heat, salt and dissolved oxygen content are quantified at each depth. While the near surface heat content is consistent with the net surface heat flux, heat content of the deeper layers is driven by gyre‐scale water mass changes. Below ∼150m, heat and salt content display intraseasonal variability which has not been resolved by previous studies. A mode‐1 baroclinic internal tide is detected as a peak in the power spectra of water mass properties. The depth of minimum variability is at ∼415m for both temperature and salinity, but this is a depth of high variability for oxygen concentration. The deep variability is dominated by the intermittent appearance of Mediterranean Water, which shows evidence of filamentation. Susceptibility to salt fingering occurs throughout much of the water column for much of the year. Between about 700–900 m, the water column is susceptible to diffusive layering, particularly when Mediterranean Water is present. This unique ability to resolve both high vertical and temporal variability highlights the importance of intraseasonal variability in upper ocean heat and salt content, variations that may be aliased by traditional observing techniques.

The mechanisms of iron supply to the euphotic zone in this region are poorly understood, and numerical studies of iron transport have until now omitted fine-scale (sub-mesoscale) dynamics which have been shown to significantly increase vertical transport in other parts of the ocean. We present the first sub-mesoscale-resolving study of the flow and vertical transport in this region. The modelled transport and flow structure agree well with observations. We find that an increase in horizontal resolution from mesoscale-resolving (1/20°) to 1/80° resolves sub-mesoscale filamentary frontal structures in which vertical velocities are dramatically higher and are consistent with available observations. Lagrangian tracking shows that water is advected to the surface from much greater depth in the sub-mesoscale-resolving experiment, and that vertical exchange is far more rapid and frequent. This study of sub-mesoscale vertical velocities sets the foundation for subsequent investigation of iron transport in this environment.}},

Temperature/salinity profiles from Argo floats are used to derive the mixed layer depth. All terms in the heat budget are estimated directly from available data. The domain-averaged terms of oceanic heat advection, entrainment, diffusion, and air–sea flux are largely consistent with the evolution of the mixed layer temperature. The mixed layer temperature undergoes a strong seasonal cycle, which is largely attributed to the air–sea heat fluxes. Entrainment plays a secondary role. Oceanic advection also experiences a seasonal cycle, although it is relatively weak. Most of the seasonal variations in the advection term come from the Ekman advection, in contrast with western boundary current regions where geostrophic advection controls the total advection. Substantial imbalances exist in the regional heat budgets, especially near the northern boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The biggest contributor to the surface heat budget error is thought to be the air–sea heat fluxes, because only limited Southern Hemisphere data are available for the reanalysis products, and hence these fluxes have large uncertainties. In particular, the lack of in situ measurements during winter is of fundamental concern. Sensitivity tests suggest that a proper representation of the mixed layer depth is important to close the budget. Salinity influences the stratification in the Southern Ocean; temperature alone provides an imperfect estimate of mixed layer depth and, because of this, also an imperfect estimate of the temperature of water entrained into the mixed layer from below.}},

This process has direct impacts for anthropogenic heat and carbon uptake in the Southern Ocean. Submesoscale instabilities which evolve over space (1-10 km) and time (hours to days) scales directly influence mixed layer variability and are ubiquitous in the Southern Ocean. Mixed layer eddies contribute to mixed layer restratification, while down-front winds, enhanced by strong synoptic storms, can erode stratification by a cross-frontal Ekman buoyancy flux. This study investigates the role of these submesoscale processes on the subseasonal and inter-annual variability of the mixed layer stratification using four years of high-resolution glider data in the Southern Ocean. An increase of stratification from winter to summer occurs due to a seasonal warming of the mixed layer. However, we observe transient decreases in stratification lasting days to weeks, which can arrest the seasonal restratification by up to two months after surface heat flux becomes positive. This leads to inter-annual differences in the timing of seasonal restratification by up to 36 days. Parameterizating the Ekman buoyancy flux in a one-dimensional mixed layer model reduces the magnitude of stratification compared to when the model is run using heat and freshwater fluxes alone. Importantly, the reduced stratification occurs during the spring restratification period, thereby holding important implications for mixed layer dynamics in climate models as well as physicalbiological coupling in the Southern Ocean.}},

Surface processes (winds, waves, and buoyancy forcing) are known to contribute significantly to fluxes within this layer. Recently, studies have suggested that submesoscale processes, which occur at small scales (0.1–10 km, hours to days) and therefore are not yet represented in most ocean models, may play critical roles in these turbulent exchanges. While observational support for such phenomena has been demonstrated in the vicinity of strong current systems and littoral regions, relatively few observations exist in the open‐ocean environment to warrant representation in Earth system models. We use novel observations and simulations to quantify the contributions of surface and submesoscale processes to turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) dissipation in the open‐ocean surface boundary layer. Our observations are derived from moorings in the North Atlantic, December 2012 to April 2013, and are complemented by atmospheric reanalysis. We develop a conceptual framework for dissipation rates due to surface and submesoscale processes. Using this framework and comparing with observed dissipation rates, we find that surface processes dominate TKE dissipation. A parameterization for symmetric instability is consistent with this result. We next employ simulations from an ocean front‐resolving model to reestablish that dissipation due to surface processes exceeds that of submesoscale processes by 1–2 orders of magnitude. Together, these results suggest submesoscale processes do not dramatically modify vertical TKE budgets, though such dynamics may be climatically important owing to their ability to remove energy from the ocean.

But what energizes this submesoscale turbulence remains a topic of debate. Two mechanisms have been proposed: mesoscale-driven surface frontogenesis and baroclinic mixed-layer instabilities. The goal here is to understand the differences between the dynamics of these two mechanisms, using a simple quasi-geostrophic model. The essence of mesoscale-driven surface frontogenesis is captured by the well-known surface quasi-geostrophic model, which describes the sharpening of surface buoyancy gradients and the subsequent breakup in secondary roll-up instabilities. We formulate a similarly archetypical Eady-like model of submesoscale turbulence induced by mixed-layer instabilities. The model captures the scale and structure of this baroclinic instability in the mixed layer. A wide range of scales are energized through a turbulent inverse cascade of kinetic energy that is fuelled by the submesoscale mixed-layer instability. Major differences to mesoscale-driven surface frontogenesis are that mixed-layer instabilities energize the entire depth of the mixed layer and produce larger vertical velocities. The distribution of energy across scales and in the vertical produced by our simple model of mixed-layer instabilities compares favourably to observations of energetic wintertime submesoscale flows, suggesting that it captures the leading-order balanced dynamics of these flows. The dynamics described here in an oceanographic context have potential applications to other geophysical fluids with layers of different stratifications.}},

However, a strong wind stress seasonal cycle, largely in sync with the surface heat flux cycle, is also a source of SM processes. SM restratification fluxes show distinctive signatures corresponding to both surface cooling and wind stress. The winter peak in SM activity in the Coral Sea is not in phase with the summer dominance of the mesoscale eddy kinetic energy in the region, implying that local surface layer forcing effects are more important for SM generation than the nonlocal eddy deformation field. In the topographically complex Solomon and Bismarck Seas, a combination of equatorial proximity and boundary drag generates SCVs with large-vorticity Rossby numbers (Ro \textbackslashtextasciitilde 10).

Enhanced submesoscale eddy kinetic energy (SMKE) is found in the surface mixed layer centered at 5°N. A complete SMKE budget analysis suggests that the submesoscale eddies in the surface mixed layer are generated mainly by the barotropic instability and secondarily by the baroclinic instability. The nonlinear interactions lead to a significant forward energy cascade in the submesoscale range and play an important role in balancing the energy budget. As a response to the change of energy input through barotropic instability, the SMKE exhibits a pronounced seasonal cycle with the largest and smallest values occurring in boreal autumn and spring. Furthermore, the strong seasonal cycle plays an important role in modulating the seasonality of mixed layer depth (MLD).

Climatologically, the winter subtropical surface water, coinciding with the deepest mixed layer of ∼100 m, is saltier and colder than the S‐max. Towed CTD measurements in March/April 2013 (a component of the field program SPURS) within the North Atlantic subtropical surface salinity maximum reveal several relatively fresh, warm anomalies, which deviate strongly from climatological conditions. These features introduce a large amount of freshwater into the subtropical region, exceeding the amount introduced by local rain events. Observed scales and evolution of the features strongly suggest a connection to mesoscale dynamics. This is supported by high‐resolution regional model output, which produces an abundance of features that are similar in scale and structure to those observed. It is hypothesized that turbulent transport in the surface ocean is a crucial process for setting mixed layer characteristics, which spread into S‐max stratum. High variability in the EKE implies a high potential for interannual variability in the resulting S‐max water properties by ocean dynamics in addition to the variability caused by air sea fluxes. This has likely consequences to the meridional transport of heat and freshwater of the subtropical cell in the North Atlantic and to the larger‐scale ocean and climate system.

Recent developments in numerical modeling and North Atlantic observations have shown that submesoscale ML eddies (MLE) can drive a restratifying flux to shoal the deep winter ML prior to solar heating at high latitudes. The impact of submesoscale processes on the intraseasonal variability of the Subantarctic ML is still relatively unknown. We compare 5 months of glider data in the Subantarctic Zone to simulations of a 1‐D mixing model to show that the magnitude of restratification of the ML cannot be explained by heat, freshwater, and momentum fluxes alone. During early spring, we estimate that periodic increases in the vertical buoyancy flux by MLEs caused small increases in stratification, despite predominantly down‐front winds that promote the destruction of stratification. The timing of seasonal restratification was consistent between 1‐D model estimates and the observations. However, during up‐front winds, the strength of springtime stratification increased over twofold compared to the 1‐D model, with a rapid shoaling of the MLD from >200 m to <100 m within a few days. The ML stratification is further modified under a negative Ekman buoyancy flux during down‐front winds, resulting in the destruction of ML stratification and deepening of the MLD. These results propose the importance of submesoscale buoyancy fluxes enhancing seasonal restratification and mixing of the Subantarctic ML. Seasonal restratification defined using ocean glider observations cannot be explained by seasonal warming alone Up‐front winds and increased ML horizontal buoyancy gradients promote restratification by submesoscale ML eddies in spring Fluxes of wind‐driven Ekman buoyancy flux at horizontal buoyancy fronts compete with restratifying ML eddies to mix the upper ocean}},

Two gliders sampled from December 2014 through March 2015 upstream and downstream of Shackleton Fracture Zone (SFZ). The acquired time series of mixed layer depths and buoyancy gradients enabled calculations of potential vorticity and classifications of submesoscale instabilities. The regions flanking the SFZ displayed remarkably different characteristics despite similar surface forcing. Mixed layer depths were nearly twice as deep and horizontal buoyancy gradients were larger downstream of the SFZ. Upstream of the SFZ submesoscale variability was confined to the edges of topographically-steered fronts, whereas downstream these motions were more broadly distributed. Comparisons to a 1-D mixing model demonstrate the role of submesoscale instabilities in generating mixed layer variance. Numerical output from a submesoscale-resolving simulation indicates that submesoscale instabilities are crucial for correctly reproducing upper ocean stratification.

Observations at a 1-kilometer-wide front within the Kuroshio Current indicate that the rate of energy dissipation within the boundary layer is enhanced by one to two orders of magnitude, suggesting that the front, rather than the atmospheric forcing, supplied the energy for the turbulence. The data quantitatively support the hypothesis that winds aligned with the frontal velocity catalyzed a release of energy from the front to the turbulence. The resulting boundary layer is stratified in contrast to the classically well-mixed layer. These effects will be strongest at the intense fronts found in the Kuroshio Current, the Gulf Stream, and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, all of which are key players in the climate system.}},

Presented here is an investigation of submesoscale instabilities in the mixed layer—mixed layer eddies (MLEs)—as a potential mechanism of frontal slumping that stratifies the upper ocean during the transition from winter to spring, when wintertime forcings weaken but prior to the onset of net solar warming. Observations from the global Argo float program are compared to predictions from a one-dimensional mixed layer model to assess where in the world’s oceans lateral processes influence mixed layer evolution. The model underestimates spring stratification for \textbackslashtextasciitilde75\% ± 25\% of the world’s oceans. Relationships between vertical and horizontal temperature and salinity gradients are used to suggest that in 30\% ± 20\% of the oceans this excess stratification can be attributed to the slumping of horizontal density fronts. Finally, 60\% ± 10\% of the frontal enhanced stratification is consistent with MLE theory, suggesting that MLEs may be responsible for enhanced stratification in 25\% ± 15\% of the world’s oceans. Enhanced stratification from frontal tilting occurs in regions of strong horizontal density gradients (e.g., midlatitude subtropical gyres), with a small fraction occurring in regions of deep mixed layers (e.g., high latitudes). Stratification driven by MLEs appears to constrain the coexistence of sharp lateral gradients and deep wintertime mixed layers, limiting mixed layer depths in regions of large lateral density gradients, with an estimated wintertime restratification flux of order 100 W m−2.}},

The lateral gradients are shown to be unstable to ageostrophic baroclinic instabilities and slump from the horizontal to the vertical. These instabilities, which are referred to as mixed layer instabilities (MLIs), differ from instabilities in the ocean interior because of the weak surface stratification. Spatial scales are O(1–10) km, and growth time scales are on the order of a day. Linear stability analysis and fully nonlinear simulations are used to study MLIs and their impact on mixed layer restratification. The main result is that MLIs are a leading-order process in the ML heat budget acting to constantly restratify the surface ocean. Climate and regional ocean models do not resolve the scales associated with MLIs and are likely to underestimate the rate of ML restratification and consequently suffer from a bias in sea surface temperatures and ML depths.

Furthermore, this skewness is reduced to zero during spring and autumn. There is also evidence of modest seasonal variations in the gradient Rossby number. The proposed mechanism by which relative vorticity is skewed is that the ratio of lateral to vertical buoyancy gradients, as summarized by the inverse gradient Richardson number, restricts its range during winter but less so at other times of the year. These results support recent observations and model simulations suggesting that the upper ocean is host to a seasonal cycle in submesoscale turbulence.

Here we show that current parameterizations of this turbulent mixing lead to systematic and substantial errors in the depth of the OSBL in global climate models, which then leads to biases in sea surface temperature. One reason, we argue, is that current parameterizations are missing key surface‐wave processes that force Langmuir turbulence that deepens the OSBL more rapidly than steady wind forcing. Scaling arguments are presented to identify two dimensionless parameters that measure the importance of wave forcing against wind forcing, and against buoyancy forcing. A global perspective on the occurrence of wave‐forced turbulence is developed using re‐analysis data to compute these parameters globally. The diagnostic study developed here suggests that turbulent energy available for mixing the OSBL is under‐estimated without forcing by surface waves. Wave‐forcing and hence Langmuir turbulence could be important over wide areas of the ocean and in all seasons in the Southern Ocean. We conclude that surface‐wave‐forced Langmuir turbulence is an important process in the OSBL that requires parameterization.

The main exception is that the KPP model has summer SSTs which are higher than the observations by nearly 3 ° . Mixed layer salinity (MLS) is not reproduced well by the models and the biases are large enough to produce a non-trivial density bias in the Eastern North Atlantic Central Water which forms in this region in winter. All the models develop mixed layers which are too deep in winter, with average winter mixed layer depth (MLD) biases between 160 and 228 m. The high variability in winter MLD is reproduced more successfully by model estimates of the depth of active mixing and/or boundary layer depth than by model MLD based on water column properties. After the spring restratification event, biases in MLD are small and do not appear to be related to the preceding winter biases. There is a very clear relationship between MLD and local wind stress in all models and in the observations during spring and summer, with increased wind speeds leading to deepening mixed layers, but this relationship is not present during autumn and winter. We hypothesize that the deepening of the MLD in autumn is so strongly driven by the annual cycle in surface heat flux that the winds are less significant in the autumn. The surface heat flux drives a diurnal cycle in MLD and SST from March onwards, though this effect is much more significant in the models than in the observations. We are unable to identify one model as definitely better than the others. The only clear differences between the models are KPP’s inability to accurately reproduce summer SSTs, and the OSMOSIS model’s more accurate reproduction of MLS.}},

The deep winter convection regions are key to the ventilation of the ocean interior, and changes in their properties have been related to climate change in numerous studies. Their simulation in climate models is consistently too shallow, too light and shifted equatorward compared to observations. The shallow bias is mostly associated with an excess annual‐mean freshwater input at the sea surface that over‐stratifies the surface layer and prevents deep convection from developing in winter. In contrast, modeled future changes are mostly associated with a reduced heat loss in winter that leads to even shallower winter mixed layers. The mixed layers shallow most strongly in the Pacific basin under future scenarios, and this is associated with a reduction of the ventilated water volume in the interior. We find a strong state dependency for the future change of mixed‐layer depth, with larger future shallowing being simulated by models with larger historical mixed‐layer depths. Given that most models are biased shallow, we expect that most CMIP5 climate models might underestimate the future winter mixed‐layer shallowing, with important implications for the sequestration of heat, and gases such as carbon dioxide, and therefore for climate.

Though seemingly straightforward, this paradigm relies on the assumption that an increase in the stratification of the upper ocean water column decreases the vertical mixing or overturning of the surface waters such that the supply of nutrients to the euphotic zone is reduced, and so too the primary productivity. Here we show, using observational data in the North Atlantic subtropical gyre, that while upper ocean stratification and primary productivity are strongly linked on seasonal time scales, they have at most a weak correlative relationship on interannual time scales over the modern observational record. We suggest that interannual variability in ocean biomass and primary productivity depends on a host of variables that are not easily predicted from the expected temperature response to climate variability and change. These variables include the strength of local and remote wind and buoyancy forcing and the surface or subsurface advective supply of nutrients. There is no linkage between stratification and productivity on interannual time Upper ocean overturn depends upon local wind and buoyancy forcing Interannual variability within a season is not predictive of surface productivity}},

Projections are compared to those from the previous generation (CMIP5) forced under the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). A total of 10 CMIP5 and 13 CMIP6 models are used in the two multi-model ensembles. Under the high-emission scenario SSP5-8.5, the multi-model global mean change (2080–2099 mean values relative to 1870–1899) ± the inter-model SD in sea surface temperature, surface pH, subsurface (100–600 m) oxygen concentration, euphotic (0–100 m) nitrate concentration, and depth-integrated primary production is +3.47±0.78 ∘C, -0.44±0.005, -13.27±5.28, -1.06±0.45 mmolm-3 and -2.99±9.11 \%, respectively.

Projected exposure of the marine ecosystem to these drivers of ocean change depends largely on the extent of future emissions, consistent with previous studies. The ESMs in CMIP6 generally project greater warming, acidification, deoxygenation, and nitrate reductions but lesser primary production declines than those from CMIP5 under comparable radiative forcing. The increased projected ocean warming results from a general increase in the climate sensitivity of CMIP6 models relative to those of CMIP5. This enhanced warming increases upper-ocean stratification in CMIP6 projections, which contributes to greater reductions in upper-ocean nitrate and subsurface oxygen ventilation. The greater surface acidification in CMIP6 is primarily a consequence of the SSPs having higher associated atmospheric CO2 concentrations than their RCP analogues for the same radiative forcing.

In this paper, it is shown that the magnitude and penetration of vertical fluxes are strongly modified by horizontal gradients in buoyancy and momentum. A classic example is the strong restratification resulting from frontogenesis in regions of confluent flow. Frictional forces acting on a baroclinic current either imposed externally by a wind stress or caused by the spindown of the current itself also modify the stratification by driving Ekman flows that differentially advect density. Ekman flow induced during spindown always tends to restratify the fluid, while wind-driven Ekman currents will restratify or destratify the mixed layer if the wind stress has a component up or down front (i.e., directed against or with the geostrophic shear), respectively. Scalings are constructed for the relative importance of friction versus frontogenesis in the restratification of the mixed layer and are tested using numerical experiments of mixed layer fronts forced by both winds and a strain field. The scalings suggest and the numerical experiments confirm that for wind stress magnitudes, mixed layer depths, and cross-front density gradients typical of the ocean, wind-induced friction often dominates frontogenesis in the modification of the stratification of the upper ocean. The experiments reveal that wind-induced destratification is weaker in magnitude than restratification because the stratification generated by up-front winds confines the turbulent stress to a depth shallower than the Ekman layer, which enhances the frictional force, Ekman flow, and differential advection of density. Frictional destratification is further reduced over restratification because the stress associated with the geostrophic shear at the surface tends to compensate a down-front wind stress.}},

This estimate is based on the large‐eddy method, allowing the use of measurements of turbulent energy at large scales O(1–10 m) to diagnose the rate of energy dissipated through viscous processes at scales O(1 mm). The Seaglider data considered here were obtained in a region of high stratification (1 × 10−4<N < 1×10−2s−1), where previous implementations of this method fail. The large‐eddy method is generalized to high‐stratification by high‐pass filtering vertical velocity with a cutoff dependent on the local buoyancy frequency, producing a year‐long time series of dissipation rate spanning the uppermost 1,000 m with subdaily resolution. This is compared to the dissipation rate estimated from a moored 600 kHz acoustic Doppler current profiler. The variability of the Seaglider‐based dissipation correlates with one‐dimensional scalings of wind‐ and buoyancy‐driven mixed‐layer turbulence. Measuring ocean turbulence is crucial for understanding how heat and carbon dioxide are transferred from the atmosphere to the deep ocean. However, measurements of ocean turbulence are sparse. Here autonomous Seagliders are used to estimate turbulence in the surface kilometer of the North Atlantic Ocean. Using an estimate of the vertical water velocity from the flight of the Seaglider through the water, we estimate turbulence by assuming the energy of the largest turbulent fluctuations is representative of the energy dissipated at molecular scales. This approach has been used previously in an ocean region where the vertical gradient of density is small. Our results show that this previous approach fails when the vertical density gradient increases, as it does not account for other processes that are unrelated to turbulence. We introduce a generalized method that isolates only the turbulent processes by accounting for the strength of the vertical density gradient. We show that this new estimate agrees with other turbulence measurements. Our estimate also agrees well with a simple estimates of turbulence from atmospheric processes. This study therefore presents method that can be applied to existing and new Seaglider data to greatly increase our measurements of ocean turbulence. Generalized method of estimating dissipation rate from Seagliders filtered by stratification increases scope of ocean turbulence estimates Annual cycle of turbulent dissipation in the top 1,000 m in the North Atlantic reveals seasonal cycle of mixing One‐dimensional scaling for wind‐ and buoyancy‐derived turbulence explains annual cycle of dissipation}},

We argue this rescaled PV is more representative of the dynamics, in particular to evaluate the respective impact of mixing and friction on the generation of geostrophic circulation. The impact of mixing at global scale, which only modifies the global stratification at rest, is taken into account in the evolution equation of this “objective” definition of PV, in the sense that it scales the PV changes with respect to its effect on the circulation. Numerically, we show that all terms can be calculated coherently using a single computation cell. We illustrate our purpose by studying the instability of coastal upwelling currents, using a numerical model at high resolution. The configuration is a periodic flat channel on the f-plane with vertical walls at the southern and northern boundaries. A constant wind is applied over a fluid at rest with an initial linear stratification. An upwelling current forms at the northern coast. After a few days, instabilities develop and vortices eventually emerge with surface intensified cyclones and subsurface anticyclones. We show that these instabilities and eddies are associated with (rescaled) PV anomalies, triggered by mixing and friction. We describe rescaled PV budgets in a layer bounded between the surface and an isopycnal level. Eulerian and Lagrangian diagnostics allow to analyze irreversible PV production terms, distinguishing the influence of advection, friction (associated with wind stress) and mixing. We find that friction plays the main role, generating negative PV anomalies, while mixing acts to dampen this negative PV production. The association of this negative PV anomaly with the outcropping front leads to the baroclinic destabilization of the upwelling front, creating subsurface anticyclonic vortices and surface intensified cyclonic vortices. Varying the strength of the wind forcing shows that mixing is the most sensitive process, with a net effect that is strongly reduced or even reversed with moderate to weak winds. When the dynamics is fully turbulent, with filaments and vortices of small sizes, the PV production by mixing and friction is enhanced but the Lagrangian diagnostics are more difficult to analyze, since fluctuations at grid scale become significant and numerical effects – associated with imperfections of the numerical schemes – spoil the PV budget calculation.}},

abstract = {{Although atmospheric forcing by wind stress or buoyancy flux is known to change the ocean’s potential vorticity (PV) at the surface, less is understood about PV modification in the bottom boundary layer. The adjustment of a geostrophic current over a sloped bottom in a stratified ocean generates PV sources and sinks through friction and diapycnal mixing. The time-dependent problem is solved analytically for a no-slip boundary condition, and scalings are identified for the change in PV that arises during the adjustment to steady state. Numerical experiments are run to test the scalings with different turbulent closure schemes. The key parameters that control whether PV is injected into or extracted from the fluid are the direction of the geostrophic current and the ratio of its initial speed to its steady-state speed. When the current is in the direction of Kelvin wave propagation, downslope Ekman flow advects lighter water under denser water, driving diabatic mixing and extracting PV. For a current in the opposite direction, Ekman advection tends to restratify the bottom boundary layer and increase the PV. Mixing near the bottom counteracts this restratification, however, and an increase in PV will only occur for current speeds exceeding a critical value. Consequently, the change in PV is asymmetric for currents of the opposite sign but the same speed, with a bias toward PV removal. In the limit of a large speed ratio, the change in PV is independent of diapycnal mixing.}},

This is here emphasised with isopycnic coordinates by generalising the PV expression to the general Navier-Stokes equations; • We propose a generalised derivation for the Haynes-McIntyre impermeability theorem, which highlights the role of the bottom boundary condition choice (e.g. no-slip vs free-slip) and mixing near the bottom boundary for the volume integral of PV. The implications of balances between volume integral of PV and boundary conditions are then analysed for specific processes at various scales: • At large scale, we show how an integral involving surface observations (derived from satellite observations) is linked to the integral of PV within a layer (between two isopycnals). This surface integral can be calculated for models and observations and can be used for validation; • At mesoscale or sub-mesoscale, we analyse the relationship between net PV anomalies and net surface density anomalies for idealised vortices and 2D fronts. This can help determining vortex or jet structures for idealised studies or empirical methodologies; • We also confirm and integrate previous results on the modification of PV within a bottom boundary layer into a single diagnostic taking into account the effect of density and velocity modifications by diabatic processes along the topography and diapycnal mixing within the boundary layer.}},

We suggest a procedure that expresses J in terms of buoyancy and momentum fluxes by small‐scale turbulence SS, submesoscales SM and mesoscales M. We employ the latest parameterizations of these processes and derive analytic expressions of the diabatic and frictional J fluxes for arbitrary wind stresses; we then consider the case of an Ekman flow. Small‐scale turbulence: at z=0, down and up‐front winds contribute equally to the frictional component of J while the diabatic component is much larger than that of mesoscales. Submesoscales: the geostrophic contributions to both diabatic and frictional J have the same sign while the wind contributions have opposite signs. Their magnitude depends on the SM kinetic energy which is derived in terms of large‐scale parameters. Comparison with numerical simulations is limited since the ones available resolve M but not SM. They concluded that the field patterns of the J fluxes are very similar to those obtained without resolving M, in agreement with the present analysis; a second conclusion that the diabatic component of J is an order of magnitude larger than the frictional one, is also in accordance with present results. When wind stresses are accounted for, down‐front winds lower PV and up‐front winds increase it. The changes in Hoskins' criterion for the onset of symmetric instabilities are discussed.

It is found that surface PV loss over western boundary current regions and their interior extension is a robust feature over the North Pacific and Atlantic basins. At high latitudes, mechanical and diabatic effects act in concert in the North Atlantic to drive the net PV exit. In the Pacific, however, these effects oppose each other and the net entry–exit of PV is more uncertain. At low latitudes, surface winds are found to be particularly important in setting the surface PV exit in the Pacific, equatorward of the intertropical convergence zone.}},

In this paper, a series of offline-nested numerical simulations is used to study submesoscale flow in the Drake Passage and Scotia Sea regions of the Southern Ocean. These simulations are initialized from an ocean state estimate for late April 2015, with the intent to simulate features observed during the Surface Mixed Layer at Submesoscales (SMILES) research cruise, which occurred at that time and location. The nested models are downscaled from the original state estimate resolution of 1/12° and grid spacing of about 8 km, culminating in a submesoscale-resolving model with a resolution of 1/192° and grid spacing of about 500 m. The submesoscale eddy field is found to be highly spatially variable, with pronounced hot spots of submesoscale activity. These areas of high submesoscale activity correspond to a significant difference in the 30-day average mixed layer depth between the 1/12° and 1/192° simulations. Regions of large vertical velocities in the mixed layer correspond with high mesoscale strain rather than large . It is found that is well correlated with the mesoscale density gradient but weakly correlated with both the mesoscale kinetic energy and strain. This has implications for the development of submesoscale eddy parameterizations that are sensitive to the character of the large-scale flow.}},

Under the same wind stress and adjusting for buoyancy flux, we find the mixed layer average turbulent vertical kinetic energy in the open ocean typically twice that in the lake. The increase is consistent with models of Langmuir turbulence, in which the wave Stokes drift, and not wave breaking, is the dominant mechanism by which waves energize turbulence in the mixed layer. Applying these same theories globally, we find enhanced mixing and deeper mixed layers resulting from the inclusion of Langmuir turbulence in the boundary layer parameterization, especially in the Southern Ocean. Mixed layer turbulence is stronger in ocean than in lake for same air‐sea flux The extra turbulence is due to larger surface waves in the ocean Langmuir circulation theories explain most of the observed difference}},

abstract = {{The surface mixed layer of the world ocean regulates global climate by controlling heat and carbon exchange between the atmosphere and the oceanic interior1–3. The mixed layer also shapes marine ecosystems by hosting most of the ocean’s primary production4 and providing the conduit for oxygenation of deep oceanic layers. Despite these important climatic and life-supporting roles, possible changes in the mixed layer during an era of global climate change remain uncertain. Here we use oceanographic observations to show that from 1970 to 2018 the density contrast across the base of the mixed layer increased and that the mixed layer itself became deeper. Using a physically based definition of upper-ocean stability that follows different dynamical regimes across the global ocean, we find that the summertime density contrast increased by 8.9 ± 2.7 per cent per decade (10−5–10−4 per second squared per decade, depending on region), more than six times greater than previous estimates. Whereas prior work has suggested that a thinner mixed layer should accompany a more stratified upper ocean5–7, we find instead that the summertime mixed layer deepened by 2.9 ± 0.5 per cent per decade, or several metres per decade (typically 5–10 metres per decade, depending on region). A detailed mechanistic interpretation is challenging, but the concurrent stratification and deepening of the mixed layer are related to an increase in stability associated with surface warming and high-latitude surface freshening8,9, accompanied by a wind-driven intensification of upper-ocean turbulence10,11. Our findings are based on a complex dataset with incomplete coverage of a vast area. Although our results are robust within a wide range of sensitivity analyses, important uncertainties remain, such as those related to sparse coverage in the early years of the 1970–2018 period. Nonetheless, our work calls for reconsideration of the drivers of ongoing shifts in marine primary production, and reveals stark changes in the world’s upper ocean over the past five decades. Oceanographic observations from 1970–2018 reveal substantial changes in the summer upper-ocean structure, showing a thickening of the mixed layer and a density gradient increase at its base.}},

abstract = {{The warming climate is causing a strengthening of ocean stratification. Ocean stratification, in turn, has significant impacts on physical, biogeochemical and ecological processes, such as ocean circulation, ventilation, air-sea interactions, nutrient fluxes, primary productivity and fisheries. How these processes are affected in detail by changing stratification still remains uncertain and are likely to vary locally. Here, we investigate the state and trend of different parameters characterizing the stratification of the global upper-ocean which can be derived from Argo profiles for the period 2006-2021. Among those parameters are mixed layer depth, magnitude and depth of the vertical stratification maximum. The summertime stratification maximum has increased in both hemispheres, respectively. During wintertime, the stratification maximum has intensified in the Northern Hemisphere, while changes in the Southern Hemisphere have been relatively small. Comparisons to mixed layer characteristics show that a strengthening stratification is mainly accompanied by a warming and freshening of the mixed layer. In agreement with previous observational studies, we find a large-scale mixed layer deepening that regionally contributes to the increasing stratification. Globally, the vertical stratification maximum strengthens by 7-8\% and the mixed layer deepens by 4 m during 2006-2021. This hints to an ongoing de-coupling of the surface ocean from the ocean interior. The investigated changes can help determine the origin of existing model-observation discrepancies and improve predictions on climate change impact on upper-ocean ecology and biogeochemistry.}},
